# Course overview
This course is aimed at people with little to no knowledge of programming in R language and little to no experience with programming. We will introduce basic concepts such as variables and functions, how to use command line, how to write and share scripts and how and where to look for help. Later, we will learn about various data types and data operations, and we will finish with basic exploration and visualisation of datasets. After finishing this crash course, you should be able to load, access, explore and visualize your data. You should also understand basic programming terminology and online help and be able work on projects in R on your own.
